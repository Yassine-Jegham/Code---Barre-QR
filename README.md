# Code---Barre-QR
This Python script uses OpenCV and the pyzbar library to detect and decode QR codes in real time from a camera. It loads authorized data from text files and checks whether the detected QR codes match this data. If there is a match, it displays "Authorized" and a green outline around the code, otherwise it displays "Un-Authorized" in red. In addition, it offers the possibility of generating a speech synthesis to inform of the detection of the QR code. This code is ideal for QR code-based access control applications. Be sure to customize the allowed data files to meet your specific needs.
